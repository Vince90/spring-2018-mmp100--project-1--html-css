   <p>Christopher Nolan is an innovative filmmaker from London, England. His original screenplays and adaptations have catapulted the modern-day film era forward as his immersive stories and complex structure challenged audiences across the globe. His popular works include,<i> The Dark Knight trilogy, Dunkirk, Inception, Interstellar</i> and <i>The Prestige</i>. His body of work has separated himself from other directors and screenplay writers in that his stories demonstrate depth and psychological suspense in a day where everything is a remake. 2017's Dunkirk was filmed entirely in 65mm film, as opposed to 35mm, creating a grand-scale picture that captivated those in attendance.  The film's minimal dialogue allowed for its imagery and sound to completely immerse the audience. Nolan is currently nominated for an Academy award for Best Director and Best Picture.</p>
